1) test cases
2) read/write lock
3) conflict management
4) SplObjectStorage and ArrayObject support (currently they are not transactable meaning that they will
   be only respeected if the setter is called; normally this will cause to call the setter with the
   previous value:
   $arr = $entity->getArray();
   $arr['foo'] = $bar;
   $entity->setArray($arr);
5) Persistent transactions may be more flexible:
   A) store persistence in database (current implementation)
   B) store persistence in sessions
